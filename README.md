# node-express-generator-typescript
A TypeScript version of express-generator --no-view

## Motivation
To have a fresh boilerplate of express-generator using TypeScript

Easy to use and start your API server with express js

## How to use
 - For windows -> run npm run cleanuo-windows
 - For mac/linux -> rm -r .git && echo 'cleanup done', happy hacking!
 
We clean the repo files because we didn't setup the right practice yet.

Have fun!

# node-express-generator-typescript
A TypeScript version of express-generator --no-view

## Motivation
To have a fresh boilerplate of express-generator using TypeScript

Easy to use and start your API server with express js

## How to use
 - For windows, run -> npm run cleanup-windows
 - For unix based, run -> npm run cleanup-windows
 
We clean the repo files because we didn't setup the right practice yet.

Have fun!

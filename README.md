# node-express-generator-typescript
A TypeScript version of express-generator --no-view

## Motivation
To have a fresh boilerplate of express-generator using TypeScript

Easy to use and start your API server with express js

## How to use
 - git clone https://github.com/galoberlyn/node-express-generator-typescript.git
 - For windows, run -> npm run cleanup-windows
 - For unix based, run -> npm run cleanup-windows
 - npm install OR yarn install
 - To run the development server --> npm run dev
 - To build a production build --> npm run build
 - To run the production build --> npm run start
 
We clean the repo files because we didn't setup the right practice yet.

Have fun!
